        <p style="color: darkolivegreen;background-color: antiquewhite;"> 
            My name is Elaina Michetti and I am a first-year Architecture major at NJIT, transferring as a sophomore from Muhlenberg College. Previously a double-major in Biology on the pre-vet track and Dance, I am excited to change my course of studies and begin my education to become an architect.
             <br> Outside of school, my hobbies include dance, theater, baking, and dog sitting. I currently take classes at the New Jersey School of Ballet, and can be seen in local theater productions. In my free time I love to bake and sculpt elaborate cakes, as well as dog-sit for local pet parents with my business Pet Care Services by Elaina Michetti.
             <br> I currently work as an AutoCad drafting and survey intern with JoeMax Telecom, LLC, and as a juice barista at The Juice House in Garwood, NJ. I love my job designing fiber optic cable installations, and I’m excited to see where this in combination with my education takes me. I’m unsure what specific career in architecture I want to pursue, but it has always been a dream of mine to work for the Walt Disney company both as a designer and a performer.
